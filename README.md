### Objective:

The project aims to analyze historical hotel reservation data to uncover trends, identify key business insights, and support data-driven decision-making. This includes improving customer satisfaction, increasing revenue, and optimizing operational efficiency.

### Scope:

1. Understand booking patterns (e.g., peak seasons, booking channels, lead times).
2. Evaluate cancellation trends and their causes.
3. Identify key customer segments and their preferences.
4. Examine the impact of pricing strategies, promotions, and room availability on bookings.
5. Provide actionable insights for marketing, pricing, and inventory management.
